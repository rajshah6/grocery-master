This program simulates a grocery store inventory system, where users can add, save, and access food items stored in a large text file. Users can search for items using either the SKU or the item name. The program leverages an array to store items, using a custom class for the food items. All data is stored in `inventory.txt`, which is manually accessible.

## Features
